# DS334_Final_Project

This project examined chip statistics from 2000 to 2020. The data comes from Kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelbryantds/cpu-and-gpu-product-data. The major findings were that Moore's law holds true within this data, clearly showing a doubling of transistors every one and a half years in both CPUs and GPUs. This project found that performance also doubled every one and half years, likely due to the increased transistors, increased frequencies, and decreased processor size. Finally, the project attempted to classify chips based on five statistics: die size, frequency, processor size, transistors, and thermal design power by first using a k-nearest neighbors model and then after with a shallow neural network. Both of these model didn't perform all that well.
